# Java_IOStream
  Java brings various Streams with its I/O package that helps the user to perform all the input-output operations. These streams support all the types of objects, data-types, characters, files etc. to fully execute the I/O operations.

#Input Stream: These streams are used to read data that must be taken as an input from a source array or file or any peripheral device. For eg., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream etc.

#Output Stream: These streams are used to write data as outputs into an array or file or any output peripheral device. For eg., FileOutputStream, BufferedOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream etc.
